This is a small web game built during the Wordle craze of early 2022. Gameplay is similar to the original version of teh game, however the game is played in hard mode and once a word is found, a new word is picked and the player is granted extra chances to get the new word, starting with the previous solution as the first guess. Play continues until the player is unable to get the hidden word in the chances granted.
